One of the most interesting aspects of *The Silver Chair* is the character development of Eustace and Jill. In the previous movie, *The Voyage of the Dawn Treader*, Eustace was a spoiled and selfish boy who learned to be more humble and brave after becoming a dragon. In this movie, he has grown into a loyal and courageous friend who helps Jill overcome her fears and doubts. Jill, on the other hand, is a new character who has never been to Narnia before. She is curious and adventurous, but also insecure and impulsive. She often makes mistakes and forgets the signs that Aslan gave her to follow. However, she also learns from her experiences and becomes more confident and faithful.
 
Another intriguing aspect of *The Silver Chair* is the theme of free will and obedience. The movie explores the question of whether it is better to follow one's own desires or to obey a higher authority. This is exemplified by the contrast between Prince Rilian and Puddleglum, the marsh-wiggle. Prince Rilian is a noble and handsome prince who has been enchanted by a witch to forget his true identity and serve her as her knight. He believes that he is happy and free in her underground kingdom, but he is actually enslaved and miserable. Puddleglum, on the other hand, is a humble and pessimistic creature who always expects the worst. He follows Aslan's will even when he does not understand it or like it. He is the one who helps Eustace and Jill break the witch's spell and rescue Prince Rilian.
