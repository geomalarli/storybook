Network security and cryptography are two essential topics in modern computing, as more and more of our personal and professional activities take place online. In his book *Network Security and Cryptography*, Bernard L. Menezes provides a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to the principles and practices of computer security. The book covers three main areas of computer security: network security, system security, and application security.
 
Network security focuses on the cryptographic algorithms and protocols that are used to protect data in transit and at rest. The book covers symmetric-key encryption, public-key encryption, hash functions, digital signatures, key management, and authentication protocols. It also discusses the vulnerabilities and attacks on popular non-cryptographic network protocols, such as TCP/IP, DNS, ARP, DHCP, and SNMP.

System security deals with the defense mechanisms that are implemented at the operating system level and the network level. The book covers malware detection and prevention, access control models and policies, firewalls, VPNs, network-level access control, and intrusion detection systems. It also explains how to perform security audits and assessments, and how to comply with legal and ethical issues in computer security.
 
Application security covers the security aspects of various software applications and services that are used online. The book covers web security, email security, e-commerce security, cloud computing security, mobile security, social network security, and next-generation web services. It also explores the emerging topics of quantum cryptography, biometric security, blockchain technology, and artificial intelligence in computer security.
 
*Network Security and Cryptography* is a comprehensive and accessible book that covers both the theoretical foundations and the practical applications of computer security. It is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, information technology, engineering, and related disciplines. It is also a valuable reference for professionals and practitioners who want to learn about the latest developments and challenges in computer security.
