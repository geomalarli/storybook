However, Audi VWTool is not compatible with all Windows versions, and you may encounter some issues when trying to install or run it on Windows 7. In this article, we will show you how to use Audi VWTool 2.0.9 for Windows 7 (English), a modified version of the original software that works on Windows 7 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
 
## What Is Audi VWTool?
 
Audi VWTool is a diagnostic software that communicates with your car's ECUs via an OBD-II interface. It supports most VAG vehicles, which stands for Volkswagen Audi Group, including Audi, Bentley, Cupra, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, Å koda, and Volkswagen.
 
Audi VWTool can perform various functions that are not available on standard OBD-II scanners, such as:
 
- Reading and clearing diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) from all modules
- Viewing and logging live data from sensors and actuators
- Adjusting basic settings and adaptations
- Performing output tests and readiness monitors
- Coding and programming modules
- Accessing optical bus diagnostics and service reminders

Audi VWTool is similar to VCDS (VAG-COM Diagnostic System), a more popular and updated diagnostic software from Ross-Tech. However, Audi VWTool is free to download and use, while VCDS requires a license and a compatible cable.
