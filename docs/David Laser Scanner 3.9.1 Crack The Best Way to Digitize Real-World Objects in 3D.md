# How to Use David Laser Scanner 3.9.1 to Create 3D Models
 
David Laser Scanner is a software that allows you to create 3D models of objects and surfaces using a webcam and a laser pointer. It is a low-cost and easy-to-use system that can achieve high accuracy and resolution with reasonable hardware. In this article, we will show you how to use David Laser Scanner 3.9.1 to scan and export your own 3D models.

## What You Need
 
- A computer with Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10/11 and David Laser Scanner 3.9.1 installed. You can download the software from [here\[^1^\]](https://en.freedownloadmanager.org/Windows-PC/DAVID-Laserscanner.html) or [here\[^2^\]](https://david-laserscanner.software.informer.com/3.4/). The software is not free, but you can try it for 30 days before buying it.
- A webcam with a resolution of at least 640x480 pixels and a frame rate of at least 15 fps. You can use any standard USB webcam or an industrial camera with a FireWire or GigE interface.
- A laser pointer with a wavelength of around 650 nm (red) and a power of less than 5 mW. You can use any cheap laser pointer or a line laser module that projects a straight line instead of a dot.
- A calibration pattern that consists of two planes at right angles with a checkerboard pattern on each plane. You can print your own calibration pattern from the software or buy a ready-made one from [here](http://www.david-vision-systems.de/shop/).
- An object or surface that you want to scan. It should have some texture and contrast, and it should not be too shiny, transparent, or dark.

## How to Scan

1. Set up your webcam and laser pointer on stable stands or tripods. Make sure they are aligned horizontally and vertically, and that the laser beam is perpendicular to the camera axis.
2. Place your calibration pattern on a flat surface and adjust its position and orientation so that it fills most of the camera view. Make sure there is no shadow or reflection on the pattern.
3. Start David Laser Scanner and click on the Calibration button. Follow the instructions on the screen to calibrate your camera and laser. You will need to sweep the laser line over the calibration pattern several times until the software detects it and shows you a green overlay.
4. Once the calibration is done, click on Next and then on Scan. Place your object or surface in front of the calibration pattern and adjust its position and orientation so that it fills most of the camera view. Make sure there is no shadow or reflection on the object or surface.
5. Sweep the laser line over the object or surface slowly and steadily from left to right or from top to bottom. The software will capture the shape of the object or surface as a point cloud and show you a preview on the screen.
6. If you want to scan more than one side of the object or surface, you can rotate it or move it to another position and repeat the scanning process. The software will automatically align and merge the scans into one 3D model.
7. When you are done scanning, click on Finish and then on Export Mesh. You can choose to export your 3D model as an STL, OBJ, PLY, or VRML file. You can also edit your 3D model using the tools in the software or in other programs.

## Tips and Tricks

- You can improve the quality of your scans by using a higher resolution camera, a brighter laser, a larger calibration pattern, a better lighting condition, and a smoother scanning motion.
- You can reduce the noise and artifacts in your scans by using the filters and smoothing tools in the software or in other programs.
- You can add color and texture to your scans by using the Texture option in the software or by applying images or materials in other programs.
