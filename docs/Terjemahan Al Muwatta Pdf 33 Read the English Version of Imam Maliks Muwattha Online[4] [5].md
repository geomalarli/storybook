Terjemahan Al Muwatta Pdf 33 is a digital version of the translation of Al-Muwatta, one of the earliest and most authentic collections of hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) in Islam. Al-Muwatta was compiled by Imam Malik ibn Anas, the founder of the Maliki school of jurisprudence, in the 8th century CE. It contains about 1900 hadiths, covering various topics such as prayer, zakat, fasting, pilgrimage, marriage, divorce, inheritance, commerce, jihad, and more.
  
The translation of Al-Muwatta into Indonesian was done by Dr. Muhammad Thalib al-Husaini, a renowned scholar and professor of Islamic studies at the University of Indonesia. He based his translation on the most reliable manuscripts and editions of Al-Muwatta, and added explanatory notes and references to other sources. The translation was first published in 1983, and has since been reprinted several times.

One of the distinctive features of Al-Muwatta is that it does not only contain hadiths, but also the opinions and rulings of Imam Malik and other prominent jurists of his time. This makes it a comprehensive source of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) as well as a collection of hadith. Imam Malik was known for his adherence to the practice of the people of Medina, who were considered to be the most knowledgeable and faithful followers of the Prophet Muhammad. He also used his own reasoning and analogy to derive legal judgments from the Quran and the Sunnah.
  
Another feature of Al-Muwatta is that it is organized according to topics rather than narrators. This makes it easier to find and compare the relevant hadiths and rulings for a given issue. The topics are arranged in a logical order, starting with the fundamentals of faith and worship, and ending with the details of civil and criminal law. Each topic is divided into chapters, and each chapter contains a number of hadiths and rulings related to that subject.
