- **Built-in encryption**: pcAnywhere connections are always done over a 256-bit encrypted connection, which exceeds industry standards and protects your data from unauthorized access[^1^].
- **File transfer**: pcAnywhere allows you to transfer files in both directions between the host and the remote computer, which can be useful for updating software, sharing documents, or backing up data[^1^].
- **Multiple sessions**: pcAnywhere allows you to have an unlimited number of sessions going at once, as long as you have enough bandwidth. This means you can connect to and control multiple computers at the same time, which can be handy for help-desk situations or multitasking[^1^].
- **Clients for all operating systems**: pcAnywhere has a client for Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Blackberry, and Windows Mobile, and is working on clients for iPhone and Android OS. It also has a Java client that can run on any platform that supports Java. This gives you more flexibility and compatibility when connecting to different devices[^1^] [^2^].
- **Easy interface**: pcAnywhere has a simple and intuitive interface that lets you find, connect to, and control the hosts you need with minimal hassle. It also has an in-depth interface for advanced users who need more options and details[^1^] [^3^].

However, pcAnywhere also has some drawbacks that you should be aware of before using it. Some of the weaknesses are:

- **Lack of wizards**: pcAnywhere does not have any wizards to guide you through the host/remote setup process, which can make it difficult and time-consuming for beginners or inexperienced users. You have to manually configure the connection settings and options, which can be confusing and error-prone .
- **Limited support for Internet connection**: pcAnywhere requires you to know the IP address of the host computer if you want to connect over the Internet, which can change frequently or be blocked by firewalls or routers. It also does not provide any support or troubleshooting for this connection method, which can leave you stranded if you encounter any problems .
- **No access restriction**: pcAnywhere does not allow you to restrict access to specific folders or files on the host computer, which means that anyone who connects to it can see and modify everything on it. This can pose a security risk or a privacy issue, especially if you share your computer with others or store sensitive data on it.

Therefore, pcAnywhere is a powerful and versatile remote access software solution that can benefit businesses and individuals who need to manage computers remotely, resolve helpdesk issues, or access data and applications from anywhere. However, it also has some limitations and challenges that may make it unsuitable or inconvenient for some users or situations. You should weigh the pros and cons of pcAnywhere carefully before deciding whether it is the right choice for you.
