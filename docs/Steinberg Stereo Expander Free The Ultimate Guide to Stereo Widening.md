# How to Enhance Your Stereo Width with Steinberg Stereo Expander Free
 
Do you want to make your stereo tracks sound wider and more spacious? Do you want to add some color and depth to your mixes without compromising the mono compatibility? If so, you might want to try Steinberg Stereo Expander Free, a plug-in that can help you achieve these goals.
 
Steinberg Stereo Expander Free is a stereo width enhancer that makes a stereo signal sound wider. It gives better results from real stereo material, as opposed to mono channels panned to different positions in the stereo image[^1^]. It has a simple interface with two main parameters: Width and Color.

- Width: Higher values result in a greater stereo width. Usually, you set Width to values between 0% and 20%. Higher values can be used for special effects.
- Color: Generates additional differences between the channels to increase the stereo enhancement. It can also add some subtle harmonics and saturation to the signal.

You can also switch the output to mono, to check for possible unwanted coloring of the sound which sometimes can occur when enhancing the stereo image[^1^]. This is useful for ensuring that your mix will translate well on different playback systems.
 
Steinberg Stereo Expander Free is a WaveLab-specific plug-in that comes with WaveLab Pro 10.0.0 or higher[^1^]. However, if you don't have WaveLab, you can still use it with other DAWs that support VST plug-ins. You just need to download it from the Steinberg website and install it on your computer.

## How to Use Steinberg Stereo Expander Free for Different Audio Projects
 
Steinberg Stereo Expander Free can be used for various audio projects, such as music production, podcasting, video editing, sound design, and more. However, depending on the type of project you are working on, you may want to use different settings and techniques. Here are some tips and examples:

- For music production, you can use Steinberg Stereo Expander Free to widen your instruments, vocals, synths, drums, etc. This can create a more immersive and spacious soundstage for your listeners. However, be careful not to overdo it, as too much stereo width can cause phase issues and make your mix sound thin and weak. A good rule of thumb is to keep your low frequencies (bass and kick) in mono or narrow stereo, and use wider stereo for your high frequencies (cymbals, hi-hats, etc.). You can also use different widths for different elements in your mix, such as using a wider width for your lead vocals than for your backing vocals.
- For podcasting, you can use Steinberg Stereo Expander Free to add some depth and dimension to your voice recordings. This can make your podcasts sound more professional and engaging. However, be careful not to use too much color, as this can introduce unwanted distortion and noise to your voice. A good rule of thumb is to use a low color value (around 10% or less) and a moderate width value (around 15% or less). You can also use Steinberg Stereo Expander Free on your background music or sound effects, but make sure they don't interfere with your voice clarity.
- For video editing, you can use Steinberg Stereo Expander Free to enhance your audio tracks, such as dialogue, narration, music, sound effects, etc. This can create a more realistic and cinematic sound for your videos. However, be careful not to use too much width or color, as this can make your audio sound unnatural and out of sync with your video. A good rule of thumb is to use a low width value (around 10% or less) and a low color value (around 10% or less). You can also use Steinberg Stereo Expander Free on specific audio tracks that need more stereo width, such as ambient sounds or off-screen voices.

Steinberg Stereo Expander Free is a versatile and easy-to-use plug-in that can help you improve your stereo width in various audio projects. By using it wisely and creatively, you can achieve amazing results that will impress your audience.
