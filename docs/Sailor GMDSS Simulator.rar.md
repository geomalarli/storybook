The simulator has a stand-alone mode for self-study and a network mode for individual and joint training of fleet operators with expert assessment of their competency. You can choose from four different types of GMDSS radio equipment: SAILOR 6000, SAILOR 5000, SAILOR System 4000 and SAILOR Compact 2000. In addition, the VHF&DSC FURUNO FM-8800S is included.
 
The simulator can be enhanced with a compact console that includes the real control panels from SAILOR Program 6000 units. This gives you a more realistic and immersive experience of operating the GMDSS equipment. You can also use an additional handset and active speakers for better audio quality.
  
The Sailor GMDSS Simulator is not only a useful tool for learning and practicing the GMDSS operations, but also a valuable preparation for the GMDSS training and certification. The GMDSS training and certification are required for any personnel who will have radio communication duties onboard vessels fitted with GMDSS equipment.
 
The GMDSS training and certification are based on the international requirements of INMARSAT, the IMO and the ITU. The training covers the basic concepts of GMDSS, the regulations and procedures for situations such as emergencies and distress, and the practice and understanding of radio-telephone communications and equipment.
 
The GMDSS certification consists of two types of licenses: the General Operator Certificate (GOC) and the Restricted Operator Certificate (ROC). The GOC is required for mariners working in Sea Areas A1-A4, while the ROC is required for mariners working in Sea Areas A1-A2. The GOC and ROC licenses are valid for five years and can be renewed or endorsed by the relevant authorities.
 
The GMDSS training and certification can benefit you and your crew in many ways. It can improve your communication and coordination with other vessels and shore stations, and enhance your situational awareness and navigation. It can also help you prevent and manage emergencies, and access vital information and assistance.
