In this article, we will introduce you to some of the key features and benefits of IAR Embedded Workbench for MSP430, and show you how you can get started with this toolchain.
 
## What is IAR Embedded Workbench for MSP430?
 
IAR Embedded Workbench for MSP430 is a complete development toolchain for MSP430 microcontrollers that provides one toolbox in one view, giving you one uninterrupted workflow[^1^]. It includes the following components:
 
- A user-friendly integrated development environment (IDE) with project management tools and editor. The IDE supports configuration files and example projects for MSP430, linker and library tools, subversion integration, TI ULP Advisorâ¢ Software integration, and a fully integrated static analysis tool with the add-on C-STAT[^1^].
- A powerful C and C++ compiler that supports all MSP430 devices and optimizes code size and performance. The compiler includes relocating MSP430 assembler, run-time libraries, position-independent code and read-only data, support for the hardware multiplier peripheral module and intrinsic functions support power-down modes[^1^].
- A comprehensive debugger with an MSP430 simulator and support for RTOS-aware debugging on hardware. The debugger provides FET debugger support as well as power debugging to visualize power consumption in correlation with source code. In addition, it supports TI's msp430-txt output format[^1^].
- An integrated static code analysis tool that ensures code quality and compliance with standards such as MISRA C:2012. The tool can detect defects, bugs, and security vulnerabilities in your code, as well as measure code complexity and maintainability[^1^].
- On-demand training courses that help you learn how to use IAR Embedded Workbench for MSP430 effectively. When you buy a license of IAR Embedded Workbench for MSP430, you get access to free training courses through their IAR Academy on Demand offering[^1^].

## What are the latest features of IAR Embedded Workbench for MSP430?
 
IAR Systems is constantly updating and refining their tools with new features, new device support and extended capabilities. Some of the latest features of IAR Embedded Workbench for MSP430 are:

- Updated Operating System support - IAR Embedded Workbench for MSP430 is now a 64-bit Windows application and supports Windows 11[^1^].
- Editor enhancements - The IDE offers editor themes, syntax feedback, window color themes (including dark mode), and gray out inactive code[^1^]. You can also customize your editor preferences to suit your coding style.
- New XLINK linker version 10 - The linker has been updated to version 10, which offers improved performance and stability[^1^].
- Updated C-STAT - The static analysis tool C-STAT has extended its coverage of the MISRA C:2012 Coding Standard and now fully supports MISRA C:2012 Amendment 2[^1^]. This amendment adds 14 new rules and 3 new directives to the standard.
- Visual Studio Code Extension - The IAR Build extension available on Microsoft Marketplace enables you to work in Visual Studio Code (with IAR Embedded Workbench installed) to build IAR Embedded Workbench projects and run the C-STAT static analysis tool[^1^]. This allows you to leverage the features of Visual Studio Code while using IAR Embedded Workbench as your backend toolchain.
- New devices - The following new devices have been added: MSP430FR6007, MSP430FR6005, MSP430FR2672 and MSP430FR2673[^1^]. These devices are part of the MSP430FRxx FRAM family that offers ultra-low-power performance and integrated non-volatile memory.
- Elprotronic XStream-Iso and XStreamPro-Iso - Support for the new XStream-Iso and XStreamPro-Iso adapters has been added. These adapters are high-speed isolated JTAG debuggers that offer advanced features
