# How to Build and Drive ACF Cars in Garry's Mod
 
Garry's Mod is a sandbox game that lets you create and play with anything you can imagine. One of the most popular addons for Garry's Mod is ACF, which stands for Armored Combat Framework. ACF adds realistic physics, damage, and sounds to vehicles and weapons, making them more fun and challenging to use.

ACF cars are custom-made vehicles that use ACF components such as engines, gearboxes, wheels, and fuel tanks. ACF cars can be built from scratch using props and tools, or downloaded as dupes from websites like [garrysmods.org](https://garrysmods.org). Dupes are pre-made contraptions that can be spawned and modified in-game.
 
In this article, we will show you how to build and drive ACF cars in Garry's Mod, using both methods. We will also give you some tips and tricks to improve your ACF car experience.
  
## Building ACF Cars from Scratch
 
Building ACF cars from scratch requires some knowledge of basic Garry's Mod tools, such as the Weld tool, the Axis tool, the No Collide tool, and the Weight tool. You will also need to install ACF from [Github](https://github.com/nrlulz/ACF), as well as some other addons that enhance ACF functionality, such as [ACF Mobility](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1874168477), [Wiremod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=160250458), and [Sprops](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=104479034).
 
The basic steps to build an ACF car from scratch are:
 
1. Choose a prop for the chassis of your car. You can use any prop you like, but Sprops are recommended because they have better collision models and less lag.
2. Spawn an ACF engine of your choice and weld it to the chassis. You can find ACF engines in the Entities tab under Armored Combat Framework.
3. Spawn an ACF gearbox of your choice and weld it to the engine. You can find ACF gearboxes in the same tab as engines.
4. Spawn four ACF wheels of your choice and weld them to the chassis. You can find ACF wheels in the same tab as engines and gearboxes.
5. Use the Wire tool to connect the engine to the gearbox, the gearbox to the wheels, and the wheels to a pod controller. You can find pod controllers in the Wire tab under User Input Devices.
6. Use the Pod Controller tool to set up the key bindings for your car. You can find the Pod Controller tool in the Wire tab under Advanced.
7. Use the Weight tool to adjust the weight of your car components. You can find the Weight tool in the Construction tab under Physics.
8. Add any other props or features you want to your car, such as seats, lights, armor, weapons, etc.
9. Save your car as a dupe using the Duplicator tool. You can find the Duplicator tool in the Construction tab under General.

Congratulations! You have built your own ACF car from scratch. Now you can drive it around and have fun!
