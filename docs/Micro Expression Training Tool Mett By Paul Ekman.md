One of the best ways to learn how to read micro expressions is by using the **Micro Expression Training Tool (METT)** developed by Dr. Paul Ekman, the world's leading expert in emotions and facial expressions. Dr. Ekman has spent decades studying human emotions and their expressions, and has created online training tools to help people improve their emotional intelligence and deception detection abilities.
 
The METT is an online training program that teaches you how to spot micro expressions in different contexts and perspectives. It consists of four modules: Micro Expressions, Subtle Expressions, Micro Expressions Profile, and Micro Expressions Intensive. Each module provides you with videos of real people displaying micro expressions, feedback on your accuracy, and tips on how to improve your skills.
 
By using the METT, you will be able to:
 
- Recognize the seven universal emotions: anger, fear, sadness, disgust, surprise, contempt, and happiness.
- Distinguish between micro expressions and subtle expressions, which are small changes in one region of the face.
- Read micro expressions from different angles and viewpoints, such as profile or side-view.
- Achieve the maximum skill level for detecting micro expressions with extended practice sessions and new faces.

The METT is suitable for anyone who wants to enhance their emotional awareness and deception detection skills, such as police officers, security personnel, salespeople, educators, medical professionals, or anyone who works with people. The METT is also part of the Ekman Library package, which includes additional training tools on how to respond effectively to emotional expressions in different situations, such as workplace, family, or law enforcement.

How does the METT work?
 
The METT is based on the scientific research of Dr. Paul Ekman and his colleagues, who have identified the facial expressions that correspond to the seven universal emotions. These expressions are called micro expressions because they are very brief and involuntary. They can occur when a person is trying to conceal or suppress their emotions, or when they are not aware of their emotions yet.
 
The METT teaches you how to recognize these micro expressions by showing you videos of real people displaying them. You will see faces from different cultures, ages, genders, and ethnicities. You will also see faces from different perspectives, such as frontal, profile, or three-quarter view. You will have to identify the emotion that is shown in each video, and you will get immediate feedback on your accuracy. You will also get tips on how to improve your skills and avoid common mistakes.
 
The METT has four modules that cover different aspects of micro expressions:

- **Micro Expressions:** This is the basic module that introduces you to the concept and the seven universal emotions. You will learn how to spot micro expressions in full-face videos.
- **Subtle Expressions:** This module teaches you how to read subtle expressions, which are small changes in one region of the face. You will learn how to detect subtle expressions in isolated regions, such as the eyes, nose, mouth, or cheeks.
- **Micro Expressions Profile:** This module teaches you how to read micro expressions from different angles and viewpoints. You will learn how to spot micro expressions in profile or side-view videos.
- **Micro Expressions Intensive:** This module is designed to help you achieve the maximum skill level for detecting micro expressions. You will get extended practice sessions with new faces and more challenging videos.

The METT is a self-paced online training program that you can access anytime and anywhere during your subscription period. You can repeat the training as many times as you want until you master the skill of reading micro expressions.
