One of the main advantages of the longbow over the crossbow was its rate of fire. A skilled longbowman could shoot up to 12 arrows per minute, while a crossbowman could only shoot 2 or 3 bolts per minute. This meant that the longbowmen could create a deadly rain of arrows that could overwhelm the enemy before they could get close.

Another advantage of the longbow was its range and accuracy. The longbow could shoot up to 250 meters, while the crossbow could only shoot up to 150 meters. The longbow also had a flatter trajectory, which made it easier to aim and hit the target. The crossbow had a more curved trajectory, which required more skill and practice to master.
 
However, the crossbow had some advantages over the longbow as well. One of them was its penetrating power. The crossbow bolt had a heavier and thicker head than the arrow, which could pierce through armor and shields more easily. The crossbow also had a mechanical trigger, which made it easier to use and less tiring than the longbow.
 
The crossbow also had some social and political advantages over the longbow. The crossbow was more widely available and cheaper than the longbow, which made it more accessible to common soldiers and mercenaries. The crossbow also did not require as much training and practice as the longbow, which made it more appealing to urban militias and nobles who did not have much time or interest in archery.
  
The book also explores the psychological and cultural aspects of the longbow and the crossbow. The longbow was seen as a symbol of English identity and pride, as well as a weapon of honor and skill. The crossbow was seen as a weapon of cowardice and treachery, as well as a threat to the feudal order and the chivalric code.
 
The book also examines the role of the longbow and the crossbow in the development of warfare and society. The longbow and the crossbow were both revolutionary weapons that changed the balance of power and the nature of combat. They also influenced the evolution of tactics, strategy, fortifications, and siege warfare.
 
READ BOOK Longbowman vs Crossbowman: Hundred Years' War 1337â60 is a well-researched and well-written book that offers a comprehensive and balanced view of the longbow and the crossbow in the Hundred Years' War. It is not only a history book, but also a story book that tells the tales of courage, skill, innovation, and rivalry between these two types of archers.
