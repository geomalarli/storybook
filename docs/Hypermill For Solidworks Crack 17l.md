## Step 1: Install and activate hyperMILL for Solidworks
 
To use hyperMILL for Solidworks, you need to have both software installed on your computer. You can download hyperMILL from the official website of OPEN MIND Technologies[^2^], the developer of hyperMILL. You can choose between a trial version or a full version, depending on your needs. You also need to have a valid license key to activate hyperMILL.

## Step 2: Create a new CAM project and import a Solidworks model
 
To start using hyperMILL for Solidworks, you need to create a new CAM project. To do this, go to the hyperMILL tab in Solidworks and click on New Project. You will see a dialog box where you can enter the name and location of your project. Click OK to create the project.
 
The next step is to import a Solidworks model into your CAM project. You can do this by opening an existing Solidworks file or creating a new one. To open an existing file, go to File > Open and browse to the location of your file. To create a new file, go to File > New and choose the type of document you want to create (part, assembly or drawing). Once you have your model ready, go to the hyperMILL tab and click on Import Model. You will see your model appear in the hyperMILL window.

## Step 3: Define the stock, coordinate system and clamping device
 
The next step is to define the stock, coordinate system and clamping device for your CAM project. The stock is the raw material that you will use for machining your model. The coordinate system is the reference frame that defines the orientation and position of your model and toolpaths. The clamping device is the fixture that holds your stock in place during machining.
 
To define the stock, go to the hyperMILL tab and click on Stock Definition. You will see a dialog box where you can choose between different types of stock shapes (box, cylinder, sphere, etc.) or use your own custom stock geometry. You can also adjust the size and position of your stock relative to your model. Click OK to confirm your stock definition.
 
To define the coordinate system, go to the hyperMILL tab and click on Coordinate System Definition. You will see a dialog box where you can choose between different types of coordinate
