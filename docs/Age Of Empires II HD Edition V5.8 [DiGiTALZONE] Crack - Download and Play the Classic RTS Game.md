1. Learn the basics of the game. Age of Empires II is a real-time strategy game that requires you to manage your economy, military, and technology. You need to gather resources, build structures, train units, research upgrades, and fight battles. You also need to know the strengths and weaknesses of each civilization, unit, and building, as well as the different game modes and victory conditions.
2. Follow a build order. A build order is a sequence of actions that you perform at the start of the game to optimize your economy and prepare for your strategy. For example, a common build order for a fast castle age is to start with 6 villagers on sheep, then 4 on wood, then 1 on boar, then 4 on berries, then another on boar, then 3 on farms, then 5 on gold, then click up to feudal age with 28 villagers. A build order can vary depending on your civilization, map, and strategy, but it is essential to follow one to avoid wasting time and resources.
3. Scout your map and your enemy. Scouting is crucial for gathering information about your surroundings and your opponent. You should scout your own base to find your resources, especially sheep, boar, gold, and stone. You should also scout your enemy's base to see what they are doing, what units they are making, what technologies they are researching, and where their weaknesses are. You can use your scout cavalry, sheep, or other units to scout in the dark age and feudal age. Later on, you can use other units like eagles, light cavalry, or monks to scout in the castle age and imperial age.
4. Balance your economy. Your economy is the backbone of your strategy and army. You need to balance your resource income according to your needs and goals. For example, if you want to make a lot of archers, you need a lot of wood and gold. If you want to advance to the next age quickly, you need a lot of food and some gold. If you want to build castles or wonders, you need a lot of stone. You also need to balance your villagers between different resources and avoid having too many idle villagers or too much stockpiled resources.
5. Adapt your strategy. Age of Empires II is a dynamic game that requires you to adjust your strategy according to the situation. You cannot always stick to one plan or follow one script. You need to react to what your opponent is doing and counter their moves. For example, if they are making a lot of infantry, you can make archers or cavalry to counter them. If they are walling up their base or turtling up with castles, you can raid their economy with fast units or siege weapons. If they are booming their economy or going for a wonder victory, you can pressure them with aggression or try to out-boom them yourself.

These are some of the basic tips and strategies that can help you improve your game in Age Of Empires II: HD Edition V5.8 [DiGiTALZONE] Crack. However, there is much more to learn and master in this complex and rewarding game.
